# Albums
It's my first application built with React Native.

I explored some functionnalities of React:
- Sharing props
- Create components
- Styling components
- Using state to re-render the view after fetching content from an API.
- Using lifecycle methods
- Handling Events like onPress
- Displaying a list of Album

# What the app does ?

- The app displays a list of albums
- The header of the card shows the artist's name and the album's name. 
- The content of the card shows the album's image
- The footer of the card shows a button that says "Buy Now!" which is in fact a link to the amazon store
